    <p><b>Monthly Charge</b> - Your monthly cycle begins on the date of the initial purchase. Once the fee has been charged at the start of the month, that charge is final, and no refund is possible.  If you wish to cancel your subscription, this should be done before the next billing cycle</p>
    <p><b>Renewal</b> - The price is valid for the full 12 months of your contract.  After that, we will renew your contract automatically, for another year, unless you cancel. The price is subject to change, but you will be notified if there is a change.</p>
